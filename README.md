# Holiday Road from Nashville
While attending Nashville Software School, Cohort 47- We were tasked with a group project to create a 'National Parks' travel itinerary app based on a chosen 'client persona'
 
My main contributions included writing Javascript to populate itinerary previews and detail snapshot/alert boxes to the DOM, as well as slight CSS relating to UI/UX
